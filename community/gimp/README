In order to install this package, you are going to have to do a bunch
of rebuilds of gtk software, with gobject/introspection/glib functionality.

Install 'gobject-introspection'

* freetype-harfbuzz
	- modify harfbuzz flags to be -Dgobject=enabled
* pango
	- use '-Dintrospection=enabled'
* atk
	- modify flags to be -Dintrospection=true
* gtk+3
	- install librsvg, and uncomment the line removing `gtk-encode-symbolic-svg`
	- use '--enable-introspection=yes'
* gdk-pixbuf
	- use '-Dintrospection=enabled'
* gegl
	- use '-Dintrospection=true'
* gexiv2
	- use '-Dintrospection=true'

This should cover all of the packages that you will have to fork & rebuild,
however if you run into build errors relating to missing '.gir' files,
try enabling the introspection option for said package.
